This is a website that blends a blog and a portfolio. It will contain contents related to multi-agent simulation, artificial intelligence, as well as many other interesting topics in computer science and engineering.

About Me
I am a Quantitative Researcher at the Climate Corporation. My research interests include machine learning, data mining and optimization algorithms. You can find my publications in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kHeI720AAAAJ&hl=en) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ye-chen/56/9b8/606).

Besides research, I like programming a lot. I started "programming" using a language called LOGO 20 years ago. After that, I programmed in Basic/Visual Basic, Pascal/Delphi, C/C++, assembly language (for both x86 and MCU), VHDL, Verilog, Matlab, and most recently R. I believe my next language will be Python...
